Main idea
=========

One of the most intriguing features of Quaterion is the caching mechanism.
A tool which can make experimenting blazing fast.

During fine-tuning, you use a pre-trained model and attach one or more layers on top of it.
The most resource-intensive part of this setup is inferring through the pre-trained layers.
They usually have a vast amount of parameters.

However, in many cases you don't even want to update pre-trained weights.
If you don't have much data, it might be preferable to only tune the head layer to prevent over-fitting and `catastrophic forgetting <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_interference>`_.
Frozen layers do not require gradient calculation. Therefore you could perform training faster.

Quaterion, meanwhile, takes it one more step further.

In Quaterion, pre-trained models are used as encoders.
If the encoder's weights are frozen, then it is deterministic and emits the same embeddings for the same input every epoch.
It opens a room for significant improvement - we can calculate these embeddings once and re-use them during training.

This is the main idea of the cache.

How to use it?
==============

`TrainableModel <quaterion.train.trainable_model.TrainableModel>`_ has
`configure_caches <quaterion.train.trainable_model.html#quaterion.train.trainable_model.TrainableModel.configure_caches>`_
method which you need to override for cache usage.

This method should return `CacheConfig <quaterion.train.cache.cache_config.CacheConfig>`_ instance containing cache settings.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: configure_caches definition

    def configure_caches(self) -> Optional[CacheConfig]:
        return CacheConfig(...)

If configuration is provided, Quaterion will perform a single pass through all datasets to populate the cache.
After that, the trainer will use only cached embeddings.
If you also provide the persistence parameters, the next run of the training will not require filling the cache.

Cache settings can be divided into parts according to their purpose:

1. Manage parameters of initial cache filling
2. Choose storage for embeddings
3. Customize how an object is cached

Options overview
----------------

The first part of the options includes ``batch_size`` and ``num_workers`` - these are directly passed to dataloader and used in the process of filling the cache.

``batch_size`` - used for cached encoder inference and does not affect the training process.
Might be useful to adjust memory/speed balance.

``num_workers`` determines number of processes to be used during cache filling.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: tune cache filling speed

    def configure_caches(self) -> Optional[CacheConfig]:
        return CacheConfig(
                batch_size=16,
                num_workers=2
            )

Storage settings are ``cache_type``, ``mapping`` and ``save_dir``.

The first two options configure the device to store the cached embeddings.

``cache_type`` set a default storage type for all encoders which will be cached.
Currently, you can store your embeddings on `CPU` or on `GPU`.

``mapping`` provides a way to define ``cache_type`` for each encoder separately.


The latter option, ``save_dir``, sets up a directory on disk to store embeddings for subsequent runs.
If you don't specify a directory for saving embeddings, Quaterion will populate the cache each time you start training.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: tune storage

    def configure_caches(self) -> Optional[CacheConfig]:
        return CacheConfig(
                cache_type=CacheType.GPU, # GPU as a default storage for frozen encoders embeddings
                mapping={"image_encoder": CacheType.CPU}  # Store `image_encoder` embeddings on CPU
                save_dir='cache'
            )

The third part of the cache settings is aimed at advanced users and will be covered in :ref:`Limitations`.

Further optimizations
=====================

Despite eliminating the most time-consuming operations via cache, there may still be places that prevent your training loop from warp speed ðŸŒ€.

Dataset usually contains features and labels for training, and in typical setup features are only used to create embeddings.
If we already have all the embeddings, raw features are not actually required anymore.
Moreover, reading the features from the disk can have significant I/O overhead and be a bottleneck during training.

A possible improvement here is to avoid reading the dataset and keep the labels during cache filling too.
Quaterion will do it automatically and bring a noticeable increase in training speed if cache is enabled and limitations described in the following chapter are met.

.. _Limitations:

Limitations
===========

There are several conditions required to use the cache:

- At least one encoder should be frozen
- Dataset should be the same on each epoch.
    This unfortunately means that dynamic augmentations are not supported by the cache.

Dataset caching has more strict rules:

- All encoders have to be frozen. If at least one is not, we can't cache labels.
- Multiprocessing is not allowed.
- Key extraction is not overridden.

Multiprocessing
---------------

Cached labels are stored in an associated dataset instance.
Therefore, this instance, and consequently the label cache, is bound to the process in which it was created.
If we use multiprocessing, then the label cache is filled in a child process.
We simply don't have access to our label cache from the parent process during training, which makes it difficult to use multiprocessing in this case.

You can use ``num_workers=None`` in cache configuration to prevent multiprocessing during the cache population.
It is preferred to use single process cache in case if you training process is I/O bound.
For example, reading images from a disk could be a bottleneck in cached training.
But for NLP tasks having more CPU for pre-processing might be more influential than I/O speed.

Key extractor
-------------

The key extractor is the function used to get the key for the entry we want to store in the cache.
By default, `key_extractor` uses the index of the item in the dataset as the cache key.
This is usually sufficient, however it has its drawbacks that you may want to avoid.

For instance, in some cases data-independent keys may not be acceptable or desirable.

You can provide custom ``key_extractors`` and extract keys from features in your own way to obtain desired behavior.

If you're using a custom key extractor, you'll need to access the features during training to get the key from it.
But retrieving features from a dataset is exactly what we wanted to avoid when caching labels.
Hence, usage of a custom key extractor makes labels caching impossible.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: provide custom key extractor

    def configure_caches(self) -> Optional[CacheConfig]:
        def custom_key_extractor(feature):
            return feature['filename']  # let's assume we have a dict as a feature

        return CacheConfig(
                key_extractor=custom_key_extractor  # use feature's filename as a key
            )


Comprehensive example
=====================

Now that we know about all the options and limitations of the cache, we can take a look at a more comprehensive example.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: comprehensive example

    def configure_caches(self) -> Optional[CacheConfig]:
        def custom_key_extractor(self, feature):
            # let's assume that features is a row and its first 10 symbols uniquely determines it
            return features[:10]

        return CacheConfig(
                mapping={
                    "content_encoder": CacheType.GPU,
                    # Store cache in GPU for `content_encoder`
                    "attitude_encoder": CacheType.CPU
                    # Store cache in RAM for `attitude_encoder`
                },
                batch_size=16,
                save_dir='cache_dir',  # directory on disk to store filled cache
                num_workers=2,  # Number of processes. Labels can't be cached if `num_workers` != 0
                key_extractors=custom_key_extractor  # Key extractor for each encoder.
                #  Equal to
                #  {
                #     "content_encoder": custom_key_extractor,
                #     "attitude_encoder": custom_key_extractor
                #  }
            )

In this setup we have 2 encoders: ``content_encoder`` and ``attitude_encoder``.
One of them stores its embeddings on the GPU, and the other on the CPU.

The cache is filled in batches of size 16.

After the cache is full, it will be stored in ``cache_dir`` under the current path.

The cache filling will be performed in two processes, and each encoder's embeddings will be stored under a key extracted using ``custom_key_extractor``.
The multiprocessing environment and the custom key extractor do not allow us to cache labels.
But with text data, it's not that important to avoid `I/O` because strings aren't as heavy as images and won't incur much overhead.
