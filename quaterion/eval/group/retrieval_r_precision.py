    Retrieval R-Precision is the ratio of `r/R`, where `R` is the number of the relevant documents
    for a given query in the collection, and `r` is the number of the truly relevant documents
    found in the `R` highest scored results for that query.

    Args:
        distance_metric_name: name of a distance metric to calculate distance or similarity
            matrices. Available names could be found in :class:`~quaterion.distances.Distance`.

    Example:

        Suppose that a collection contains 20 relevant documents for our query, and the model can
        retrieve 15 of them in the 20 highest scored results, then Retrieval R-Precision is
        calculated as r/R = 15/20 = 0.75.
